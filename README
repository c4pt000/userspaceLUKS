# Building on OSX:
The version of OpenSSL present on OSX is missing the PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC, causing libcrypto_backend to not compile. As such it must be compiled against a different copy of OpenSSL, such as from Homebrew.

```bash
brew install openssl
export OPENSSL_LIBS=$(PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig/ pkg-config --libs openssl)
export OPENSSL_CFLAGS=$(PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig/ pkg-config --cflags openssl)
./configure
```
